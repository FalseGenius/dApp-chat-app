# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

```

Deploy contract using following
```
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
